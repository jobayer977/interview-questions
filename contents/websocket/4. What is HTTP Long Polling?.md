title: What is HTTP Long Polling?
---

HTTP long polling is a technique that allows a server to send data to a client at any time, without the client having to request it. It's a technique that's often used in conjunction with websockets, but it can also be used on its own.

To overcome this deficiency, Web app developers can implement a technique called HTTP long polling, where the client polls the server requesting new information. The server holds the request open until new data is available. Once available, the server responds and sends the new information. When the client receives the new information, it immediately sends another request, and the operation is repeated. This effectively emulates a server push feature.
