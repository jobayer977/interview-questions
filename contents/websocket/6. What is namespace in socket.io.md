title: What is namespace in socket.io?
---

A Namespace is a communication channel that allows you to split the logic of your application over a single shared connection. Possible use cases: you want to create an admin namespace that only authorized users have access to, so the logic related to those users is separated from the rest of the application.

## Example

```js
var io = require('socket.io')(80)

// on connection to namespace "/admin", execute this logic
io.of('/admin').on('connection', function (socket) {
	// do something with socket
})

// on connection to namespace "/test", execute this logic
io.of('/test').on('connection', function (socket) {
	// do something with socket
})
```
