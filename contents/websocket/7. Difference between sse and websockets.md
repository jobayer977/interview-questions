---

| SSE                                                     | Websockets                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SSE connection can only push data from server to client | Websockets can push data from server to client and vice versa |
| SSE is a one-way communication                          | Websockets is a two-way communication                         |
| SSE is a simple protocol                                | Websockets is a complex protocol                              |
