title: What is Socket.IO ?
---

Socket.IO is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between the browser and the server. It's built on top of the WebSocket protocol, which makes it compatible with almost every browser. It's also compatible with older browsers that don't support WebSocket, through the use of long-polling.
