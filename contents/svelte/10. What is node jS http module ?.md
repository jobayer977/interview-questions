title: What is node jS http module ?
---

Node.js has a built-in module called HTTP, which allows Node.js to transfer data over the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

**Example**

```js
var http = require('http')

http
	.createServer(function (req, res) {
		res.write('Hello World!') //write a response to the client
		res.end() //end the response
	})
	.listen(8080) //the server object listens on port 8080
```

So when we visit http://localhost:8080/ in our browser, we will see the text "Hello World!".
