title: How can we read a file content in nodejs
---

Using fs module we can read a file content in nodejs. We can use readFile() method to read a file content. It takes two arguments, first is the file path and second is the callback function. The callback function takes two arguments, first is error and second is the data. If there is no error then data will be the file content.

```js
const fs = require('fs')

fs.readFile('file.txt', (err, data) => {
	if (err) throw err
	console.log(data)
})
```
