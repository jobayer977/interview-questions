title: What is serverless
---

Server-less does not mean that there is no server. It means that the developer does not have to worry about the server. The server is managed by the cloud provider. The developer only needs to focus on the application logic.

Serverless is a cloud computing execution model in which the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers. A serverless platform typically abstracts away the server and infrastructure management, and lets developers deploy code on demand. The serverless platform automatically scales the infrastructure up and down, and bills the developer based on the actual amount of resources consumed.

**Some of the benefits of serverless are:**

- No need to manage servers
- No need to worry about scaling
- No need to worry about security
- No need to worry about availability
- No need to worry about performance
- No need to worry about cost
- No need to worry about monitoring
