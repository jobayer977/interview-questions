- **Meta Descriptions**: A meta description is a brief summary of a page in the SERP (search engine results page) displayed below the title tag.

- **Optimize Images**: Image are considered as important for the search engine to index. When an image is optimized, it is reduced in size of the page load time and image alt text is also most important for the search engine to index.

- **Internal Linking Structure**: Internal links are important because they establish an information hierarchy for your website and also help Google get a deeper understanding of the content on your page
