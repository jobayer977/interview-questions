HTTP live streaming (HLS) is one of the most widely used video streaming protocols. Although it is called HTTP "live" streaming, it is used for both on-demand streaming and live streaming. HLS breaks down video files into smaller downloadable HTTP files and delivers them using the HTTP protocol. Client devices load these HTTP files and then play them back as video.
