title: Is cross browser testing necessary?
---

Different browsers and operating systems have different ways of handling code. The smallest errors, like forgetting a semicolon or not closing a tag, may behave differently in different environments. Some browsers may render the component easily, while others may throw errors or not show anything at all. This can be pointed out with the help of cross-browser testing. Cross-browser testing is also necessary for example in javascript code we have a new feature but old browsers don't support it. this can be also figured out while testing.
