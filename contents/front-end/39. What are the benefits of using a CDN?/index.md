- **Improving website load times**
  CDN can improve website load times by caching content and serving it from the closest server to the user. This reduces the time it takes to load a website and improves the user experience.
- **Reduce bandwidth costs**
  Through caching and other optimizations, CDNs are able to reduce the amount of data an origin server must provide, thus reducing hosting costs for website.
- **Improving website security**
  CDNs can provide additional security by blocking malicious traffic and preventing DDoS attacks.
