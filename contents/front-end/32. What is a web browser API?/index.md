Web API is provided by the browser to allow developers to interact with the browser and its features. For example, the [Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API) allows you to access the user's location, and the [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) allows you to draw graphics and animations.
