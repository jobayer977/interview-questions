title: What is SSL?
---

SSL, or Secure Sockets Layer, is an encryption-based Internet security protocol. It is used to secure communications between a client and a server. SSL is used to protect sensitive information such as credit card numbers, social security numbers, and login credentials. It is also used to authenticate websites and ensure that the data being sent is not being intercepted by a third party.
