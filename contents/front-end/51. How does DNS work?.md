The process of DNS resolution is a bit like a phone book. When you want to call someone, you look up their number in the phone book. When you want to visit a website, you look up its IP address in the DNS.

DNS resolution involves converting a hostname (such as www.example.com) into a computer-friendly IP address (such as 192.168.1.1). An IP address is given to each device on the Internet, and that address is necessary to find the appropriate Internet device.
