Functional programming (FP) is a type of paradigm or pattern in computer science. Everything is done with the help of functions in FP and the basic building blocks are functions only.

- It reduces complex problems into simple pieces.
- It helps us to debug the code quickly.
- It helps us to solve problems by breaking down the problem into smaller and smaller pieces effectively in simpler way.
- It improves modularity and reusability of the code.
- Some programming languages support nested functions which improve maintainability of the code.

**Example:**

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
	return a + b
}

function multiply(a, b) {
	return a * b
}

function subtract(a, b) {
	return a - b
}
```
