A sitemap provides information about the structure of your website. You’ll mostly use them to help crawlers and users navigate your site.

Sitemaps are available in XML (eXtensible Mark-up Language) or HTML format. XML files share important information about your website — like its internal links, backlinks, and page structure — in a language search engine crawlers understand.

These search engine crawlers (like Google’s bots) consider this data when deciding your website’s page authority and ranking on their SERPs.
