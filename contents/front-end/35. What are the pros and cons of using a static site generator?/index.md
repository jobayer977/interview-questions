### **Pros**

- **Performance:** Because static site generators create webpages in advance instead of on demand (as with a CMS), webpages load slightly faster in users' browsers.

- **Customization:** Developers can create any template they want. They are not limited by the fields provided by a CMS, nor by a CMS's built-in templates.

- **Lighter backend:** Static websites are lightweight and do not require as much code to run on the server side, whereas CMS-based websites constantly query the server side for content.

### **Cons**

- **Few or no pre-built templates:** The downside of unlimited customization is that it can take longer to get started. Many static site generators do not come with templates, and developers will have to spend a lot of time building them from scratch at first.
-
- **No user-friendly interface:** It is harder for non-developer users to publish content using a static site generator. There is no CMS interface, and working with raw unformatted data may be intimidating for users. In addition, developer support is often necessary for making website updates.
