title: What is the fastest big O?
---

The fastest possible running time for any algorithm is O(1), commonly referred to as Constant Running Time. In this case, the algorithm always takes the same amount of time to execute, regardless of the input size.

**Example of Constant Running Time:**

```javascript
function constantRunningTime(n) {
	return n
}

constantRunningTime(1) // O(1)
```

The above algorithm is the fastest possible running time for any algorithm. It always takes the same amount of time to execute, regardless of the input size.
