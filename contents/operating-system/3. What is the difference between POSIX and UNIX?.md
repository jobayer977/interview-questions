title: What is the difference between POSIX and UNIX?
---

UNIX is a proprietary operating system developed by Bell Labs in the 1970s, while POSIX is a set of standards for ensuring compatibility and interoperability between different UNIX-based operating systems. UNIX is not necessarily POSIX-compliant, but many UNIX-like operating systems, such as Linux and macOS, are POSIX-compliant.
