title: What is EventEmitter in Node.js?
---

The EventEmitter is a class which is available to us by importing the events module. It is used to handle events and emit events. It is a built-in module in Node.js.

```js
const EventEmitter = require('events')

const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter()

setTimeout(() => {
	eventEmitter.emit('tutorial', 1, 2)
}, 3000)

eventEmitter.on('tutorial', (num1, num2) => {
	console.log(num1 + num2)
})
```

The above code will output 3 after 3 seconds.
