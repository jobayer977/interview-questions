- GET: The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.
- POST: The POST method is used to submit an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.

- PUT: The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.

- DELETE: The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.

- PATCH: The PATCH method is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.
