title: How Node.js works
---

NodeJS is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code. It is built on top of the V8 JavaScript engine, the same engine that powers Google Chrome. NodeJS uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

For example when a user makes a request to a web server, the server will start processing the request and return a response. While the server is processing the request, it can still accept and process other requests. This is made possible by the event loop. The event loop allows NodeJS to perform non-blocking I/O operations even though JavaScript is single-threaded.
