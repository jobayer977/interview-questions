title: what is middleware in node js
---

Middleware is a function that has access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.

## Express Middleware

```js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

app.use((req, res, next) => {
	console.log('Time:', Date.now())
	next()
})

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
	res.send('Hello World!')
})

app.listen(3000)
```
