title: What is HTTP ?
---

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol that is used to transfer data between a client and a server. HTTP is a stateless protocol, which means that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests. There are a secure variant of HTTP called HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) that uses SSL/TLS to encrypt the communication between the client and the server.
