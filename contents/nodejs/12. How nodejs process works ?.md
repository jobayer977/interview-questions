title: How nodejs process works ?
---

NodeJS is a single threaded process. It means that it can only do one thing at a time that is why it is called as a single threaded process. But it can do many things at a time by using asynchronous programming and event loop.

When request comes from the client, it accept this request and pass though the worker thead for process necessary things. After that it will send the response to the client. In this process, it will not wait for the response from the worker thread. It will continue to accept the next request. This is the reason why NodeJS is called as a single threaded process but non-blocking I/O.
