title: what is the use of helmet in node js
---

Helmet helps you secure your Express apps by setting various HTTP headers. It's not a silver bullet, but it can help! Helmet is actually just a collection of smaller middleware functions that set security-related HTTP response headers:

## How to use

```js
const express = require('express')
const helmet = require('helmet')

const app = express()

app.use(helmet.contentSecurityPolicy())
app.use(helmet.crossOriginEmbedderPolicy())
app.use(helmet.crossOriginOpenerPolicy())
app.use(helmet.crossOriginResourcePolicy())
app.use(helmet.dnsPrefetchControl())
app.use(helmet.expectCt())
app.use(helmet.frameguard())
app.use(helmet.hidePoweredBy())
app.use(helmet.hsts())
app.use(helmet.ieNoOpen())
app.use(helmet.noSniff())
app.use(helmet.originAgentCluster())
app.use(helmet.permittedCrossDomainPolicies())
app.use(helmet.referrerPolicy())
app.use(helmet.xssFilter())

app.listen(3000)
```
