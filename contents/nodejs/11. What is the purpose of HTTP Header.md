title: What is the purpose of HTTP Header
---

An HTTP header is a field of an HTTP request or response that passes additional context and metadata about the request or response. For example, a request message can use headers to indicate it's preferred media formats, while a response can use header to indicate the media format of the returned body.

**Example**

```js
const http = require('http')

http
	.createServer(function (req, res) {
		res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/html' })
		res.write('Hello World!') //write a response to the client
		res.end() //end the response
	})
	.listen(8080) //the server object listens on port 8080
```
