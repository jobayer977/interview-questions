TypeScript is a programming language first developed by Microsoft in 2012. Its main ambition is to improve the productivity of developing complex applications.
It is an open-source language developed as a superset of JavaScript. What this means in simple terms is that any code valid in JavaScript is also valuable for TypeScript.

### Example

**Without typescript**

```js
var x = 1
var y = 2
```

**With typescript**

```ts
var x: number = 1
var y: number = 2
```
