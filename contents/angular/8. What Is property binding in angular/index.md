Property binding in Angular helps you set values for properties of HTML elements or directives. Use property binding to do things such as toggle button functionality, set paths programmatically, and share values between components.

**Example of Angular property binding**

```ts
@Component({
	selector: 'my-app',
	template: ` <img [src]="imageUrl" /> `,
})
export class AppComponent {
	imageUrl = 'https://picsum.photos/200/300'
}
```

The above code creates an Angular component that displays an image. The image's source is set to the value of the imageUrl property in the DOM node. A target property is the property of the DOM node that is set to the value of the imageUrl property.
