The lifecycle of a component/directive is managed by Angular as it creates, checks, updates, renders, and destroys. To have a view of all these occurrences and respond to these moments, Angular provides lifecycle hooks that give us visibility into these. These lifecycle hooks can be implemented by the interfaces provided in the Angular Core Library. This is the same with components and directives. Every interface contains different lifecycle hook methods, named with the interface name prefixed with ng. Like the very commonly used lifecycle hook ngOnInit() is named as ng(prefix) and OnInit (interface name).
