FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a protocol that is used to transfer files between a client and a server. FTP is a stateful protocol, which means that the server keeps the state between two requests. There are a secure variant of FTP called FTPS (File Transfer Protocol Secure) that uses SSL/TLS to encrypt the communication between the client and the server.
