title: Why do we use service in Angular?
source: https://angular.io

Service is designed to encapsulate business logic and data with different components of Angular. It is basically a class that has a well-defined purpose to do something. You can create a service class for data or logic that is not associated with any specific view to share across components.

**Example**

```ts
@Injectable({
	providedIn: 'root',
})
export class UserService {
	constructor() {}
	getUsers() {
		return [
			{ id: 1, name: 'John' },
			{ id: 2, name: 'Doe' },
			{ id: 3, name: 'Smith' },
		]
	}
}
```

**Usage**

```ts
@Component({
	selector: 'app-root',
	templateUrl: './app.component.html',
	styleUrls: ['./app.component.css'],
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
	users: any[] = []

	constructor(private userService: UserService) {}

	ngOnInit() {
		this.users = this.userService.getUsers()
	}
}
```
