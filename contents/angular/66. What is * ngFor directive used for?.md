title: What is * ngFor directive used for?
source: https://angular.io
---

The `*ngFor` directive is used to iterate over a collection. The directive is placed on a container element, which becomes the parent of the cloned templates.

The `*ngFor` expression is written in the form `let item of items`, where `items` is the collection to iterate over, and `item` is the current item in the collection.

**Example**

```ts
@Component({
	selector: 'app-root',
	template: `
		<ul>
			<li *ngFor="let item of items">{{ item }}</li>
		</ul>
	`,
})
export class AppComponent {
	items = ['item1', 'item2', 'item3']
}
```
