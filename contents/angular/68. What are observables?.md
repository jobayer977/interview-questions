Observables are declarative which provide support for passing messages between publishers and subscribers in your application. They are used frequently in Angular and are the recommended technique for event handling, asynchronous programming, and handling multiple values.

**Example**

```ts
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core'

import { Observable } from 'rxjs'

@Component({
	selector: 'app-root',
	template: `
		<div *ngIf="data | async as users">
			<ul>
				<li *ngFor="let user of users">
					{{ user.name }}
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	`,
	styleUrls: ['./app.component.css'],
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
	data: Observable<any>
	constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}
	ngOnInit() {
		this.data = this.http.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users')
	}
}
```
