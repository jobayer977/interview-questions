- Template-driven forms make use of the "FormsModule", while reactive forms are based on "ReactiveFormsModule".
- Template-driven forms are asynchronous in nature, whereas Reactive forms are mostly synchronous.
- In a template-driven approach, most of the logic is driven from the template, whereas in reactive-driven approach, the logic resides mainly in the component or typescript code.
