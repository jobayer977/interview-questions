title: Why is Node.js required for Angular?

Angular does not require Node.js directly. However, Angular CLI does require Node.js. Angular CLI is a command-line interface tool that we use to initialize, develop, scaffold, and maintain Angular applications. For example:

- npm (node package manager) comes with Node.js by default and it allows you to manage your dependencies. So, you donâ€™t have to worry about operations like adding a dependency, removing some, or updating your package.json.
- npm gives you angular CLI or ng CLI (angular command-line interface) which is a great tool for building your application easily
- Node.js allows you to spin up a lightweight web server to host your application locally in your system.
