WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is an open source project that enables real-time peer-to-peer communications between browsers and other devices without frameworks or plugins.

It used to exchange any kind of media through the web (video, audio, data, etc.) and is now used for real-time gaming, voice and video chat, and for peer-to-peer applications.

**Note**: Google Meet, Google Hangouts, and Google Duo are all examples of applications that use WebRTC.
