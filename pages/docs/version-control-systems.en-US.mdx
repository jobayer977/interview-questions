# Version Control System

So imagine you have a big notebook, and you want to share it with your friends. But, sometimes you make mistakes and draw something you don't like. With a notebook, you can't go back and erase just that one thing, you have to start a new notebook.
A Version Control System is like a special notebook that keeps track of all the changes you make, so you can go back and look at them later. And, if you make a mistake, you can go back to an earlier version and start again from there. It's kind of like using the "undo" button on a computer.
It's also a way for multiple people to work on the same notebook at the same time, and it will keep track of who made what changes and when. That way, if two people draw on the same page at the same time, the Version Control System will figure out how to put the drawings together without making a mess.s

### Repo Hosting Services

Okay, so you know how you share your notebook with your friends? Well, a Repo Hosting Service is like a big cabinet where you can put your notebook, and it will keep it safe and make it easy for your friends to find.
It's a place where you can store your notebook on the internet so that other people can access it from anywhere, even if they're not next to you. It's like a big library where you can put your notebook on a shelf and people can come and look at it or even borrow it to make their own copies.
And, just like a library, there are many different Repo Hosting Services, and each one has its own set of rules and ways of doing things. Some are free, and others cost money. Some are for big groups, and others are for just a few friends.
It's a good way to share your notebook with people all around the world and work on it together.

### Git

Git is like a magic tool that helps you use a Version Control System. It's kind of like a special pen that you use to write in your notebook.
With it, you can tell your computer to take a picture of your notebook, so you can save it and go back to it later. You can also tell git to show you the differences between different pictures of your notebook, so you can see what has changed.
It also helps you share your notebook with your friends, by sending and receiving pictures of your notebook, so you can all work on the same notebook together. Git helps you keep your notebook organized and make sure you don't lose any of your work.
Just like a pen, it is a tool that helps you write, save and share your work, in this case, it's the code.

### Start Git

To start using git, you first need to install it on your computer. You can download the appropriate version for your operating system from the official git website.
Once it is installed, you can use it in the command line to interact with your repository. The first step is to initialize a new repository. This can be done by navigating to the directory that you want to turn into a repository and running the command "git init".
After that, you can start adding files to the repository by using the command "git add" followed by the file name, or you can use "git add ." to add all files in the current directory. You also need to commit the changes you made with the command "git commit -m "message", where the message is a short description of the changes you made.
You can also connect your local repository to a remote repository like GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket. This allows you to share your code with others, collaborate on projects and keep your local repository in sync with the remote repository.
It's important to note that it is a complex tool and these are just the basic commands to get started, there's a lot more to learn and explore about it, but with these commands, you should be able to start version controlling your code.
