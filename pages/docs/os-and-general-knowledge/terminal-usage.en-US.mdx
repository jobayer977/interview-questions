# Terminal usage

The terminal is a command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to interact with the operating system by typing commands. It is also known as a shell or command prompt. These commands allow you to perform various tasks such as creating and deleting files and directories, running programs, and managing system settings.
Some commonly used commands include:

- **ls :** lists the files and directories in the current directory
- **cd :** changes the current directory
- **mkdir :** creates a new directory
- **touch :** creates a new file
- **mv :** moves or renames a file or directory
- **rm :** deletes a file or directory
- **cp :** copies a file or directory

To open the terminal on a Windows or Mac, you can use the search bar to look for "terminal" or "command prompt" and then click on the appropriate application. On Linux, it will depend on the flavor you are using, but usually you can press ctrl+alt+t or just search for terminal.
The terminal can be a powerful tool for advanced users, but it can also be dangerous if used improperly. It's important to be careful when using commands, especially those that delete or modify files.

### Basic Terminal Commands

Here are some basic explanations for the terminal commands you listed:

- **grep :** searches for a specified pattern in a file or a stream of text.
- **awk :** a text processing tool that can be used to perform operations on structured data, such as text files. It is often used to extract data from log files or CSV files.
- **sed :** a stream editor that can be used to perform basic text transformations on an input stream (a file or input from a pipeline). It is often used to perform search and replace operations on a file or stream of text.
- **lsof :** stands for "list open files". It can be used to display information about files that are open by processes running on the system.
- **curl :** a command-line tool for transferring data with URL syntax. It can be used to download files from the internet or to send HTTP requests to web servers.
- **wget :** a command-line utility for downloading files from the internet. It can be used to download files from a URL or to mirror a website.
- **tail :** prints the last 10 lines of a file by default, but you can specify a different number of lines. It's often used to view the last few lines of a log file.
- **head :** prints the first 10 lines of a file by default, but you can specify a different number of lines. It's often used to view the first few lines of a file.
- **less :** a command-line utility for viewing text files. It allows you to scroll through the file and search for text.
- **find :** a command-line utility that can be used to search for files on the file system. It can search for files based on various criteria, such as name, size, and date modified.
- **ssh :** stands for "secure shell". It is a protocol for securely connecting to a remote server and running commands on it.
- **kill :** sends a signal to a process to terminate it. It can be used to stop a running program or to force a program to exit if it is not responding.
- **dig :** stands for "domain information groper". It is a command-line tool for querying DNS servers. It can be used to look up IP addresses, MX records, and other DNS information.
  These commands are just a small sample of the many commands available in the terminal, and each of them have many options and switches, but these are the basic usage for each one.

### Questions

<details>
<summary>Can you explain the difference between relative and absolute paths in the terminal?</summary>
An absolute path is a path that starts from the root directory (/) and includes all the directories and subdirectories required to reach a specific file or directory. An absolute path will always point to the same location, regardless of the current working directory. For example, /home/user/Documents/file.txt is an absolute path.

A relative path, on the other hand, is a path that is relative to the current working directory. A relative path does not include the root directory and only includes the directories and subdirectories required to reach a specific file or directory from the current working directory. For example, if the current working directory is /home/user/Documents, then Documents/file.txt is a relative path.
