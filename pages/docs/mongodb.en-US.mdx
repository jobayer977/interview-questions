# MongoDB interview questions and answers

<summary>1. Can you explain what NoSQL databases are and how they differ from traditional relational databases?</summary>

NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that use a flexible schema model to store data. Unlike traditional relational databases, which use tables with fixed columns and rows, NoSQL databases use documents, key-value pairs, or graphs to store data. NoSQL databases can also scale horizontally, meaning that they can handle large volumes of data and traffic by distributing the data across multiple servers.

    <summary>2. Can you give me an example of when you would choose a NoSQL database over a relational database?</summary>

    NoSQL databases are often a good choice for applications that require high scalability and availability, such as e-commerce websites, social networks, and real-time analytics systems. These applications often require the ability to handle large amounts of data and traffic, and NoSQL databases provide a flexible and scalable solution to these challenges. Additionally, NoSQL databases are often more cost-effective than traditional relational databases, as they can run on commodity hardware and require less maintenance.
