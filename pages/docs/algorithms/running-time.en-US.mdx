# Running Time

An algorithm is like a list of steps to solve a problem, like a recipe for making cookies. The time it takes to follow the steps and make the cookies is called the "running time."

There are several common running time algorithms, including:

- **O(1):** constant time: the running time remains the same, no matter how big the input is. Example: Accessing an element in an array at a specific index.
- **O(log n):** logarithmic time: the running time grows logarithmically with the size of the input. Example: Binary search.
- **O(n):** linear time: the running time grows linearly with the size of the input. Example: Linear search.
- **O(n log n):** log-linear time: the running time grows as the size of the input multiplied by the logarithm of the size of the input. Example: Mergesort.
- **O(n^2):** quadratic time: the running time grows as the square of the size of the input. Example: Bubble sort.
- **O(2^n):** exponential time: the running time grows quickly as the size of the input increases. Example: Brute-force search.
