# Selection Sort

Selection sorting is a special way of sorting things so they're in order. Let's say you have a pile of blocks, and you want to put them in order from shortest to tallest. The selection sort algorithm is like a game you can play to do that.

Here's how you play:

- Look at all the blocks and find the shortest one.
- Pick up the shortest block and put it at the beginning of a new pile.
- Look at the rest of the blocks and find the next shortest one.
- Pick up the next shortest block and put it next to the first block in the new pile.
- Keep doing this until there are no more blocks left in the pile.

Now, you have a new pile of blocks that are in order from shortest to tallest. That's the selection sort algorithm! It's a fun and easy way to sort things and put them in order.
