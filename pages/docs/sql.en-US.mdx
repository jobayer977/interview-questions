# SQL Interview Questions and Answers

<details>
  <summary>1. What is SQL and what are its components?</summary>
Answer: SQL stands for Structured Query Language, which is used to manage relational databases. It is used for creating, modifying, and querying databases. The main components of SQL are Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), Data Control Language (DCL), and Transaction Control Language (TCL).
</details>
<details>
  <summary>2. What are the different types of SQL commands?</summary>
Answer: There are four types of SQL commands:
Data Definition Language (DDL): Used to create, modify, and delete database objects.
Data Manipulation Language (DML): Used to insert, update, and delete data from tables.
Data Control Language (DCL): Used to grant or revoke access to users.
Transaction Control Language (TCL): Used to control the transactions in a database.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>3. What is the difference between DDL, DML, and DCL commands in SQL?</summary>
Answer: DDL (Data Definition Language) commands are used to create, alter, and drop objects in a database, while DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands are used to insert, update, and delete data from tables. DCL (Data Control Language) commands are used to control the access to the database objects and to grant or revoke permissions to users.

  <summary>4. What is normalization in SQL and what are its types?</summary>
Answer: Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to minimize redundancy and dependency. There are different types of normalization:

- First Normal Form (1NF): It ensures that each column in a table contains atomic values.
- Second Normal Form (2NF): It ensures that each non-key column is dependent on the primary key.
- Third Normal Form (3NF): It ensures that each non-key column is dependent only on the primary key and not on other non-key columns.

</details>
<details>
  <summary>5. What are the primary key and foreign key in SQL?</summary>
Answer: A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table. It is used to enforce the integrity of the data and to ensure that there are no duplicate records. A foreign key is a column that refers to the primary key of another table. It is used to establish a relationship between two tables.

</details>
<details>
  <summary>6. What is an index in SQL?</summary>
Answer: An index is a data structure used to speed up the retrieval of data from a table. It is created on one or more columns of a table and allows the database to find and retrieve the data more quickly.

</details>
<details>
  <summary>7. What is the SELECT statement in SQL?</summary>
Answer: The SELECT statement is used to query data from one or more tables in a database. It allows you to retrieve specific columns and rows of data based on various conditions.

</details>
<details>
  <summary>8. What is the syntax of the SELECT statement?</summary>
Answer: The basic syntax of the SELECT statement is:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

The SELECT clause specifies the columns to be retrieved, the FROM clause specifies the table(s) from which to retrieve the data, and the WHERE clause specifies the condition(s) for selecting the data.

</details>
<details>
  <summary>9. What is the DISTINCT keyword in SQL and how does it work?</summary>
Answer: The DISTINCT keyword is used in SQL to retrieve only unique values from a column or set of columns in a table. When the DISTINCT keyword is used, the database engine will compare each value in the specified column(s) and return only the distinct values.

Here's an example query using the DISTINCT keyword:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column_name
FROM table_name;
```

This query will return only the unique values in the specified column_name from the table_name table.

Note that the DISTINCT keyword applies to all columns in the SELECT clause, so if you want to retrieve distinct values for multiple columns, you need to include all of them in the SELECT clause.

</details>
<details>
  <summary>10. What is the WHERE clause in SQL?</summary>
Answer: The WHERE clause is a clause in SQL that is used to filter rows based on a specified condition or set of conditions. It is used with the SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements.

</details>
<details>
  <summary>11. What is the syntax of the WHERE clause?</summary>
Answer: The basic syntax of the WHERE clause is:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

The WHERE clause is used to filter rows based on a specified condition or set of conditions. The condition can include one or more operators such as comparison operators `(=, <, >, <=, >=)`, logical operators (AND, OR, NOT), and other operators (IN, BETWEEN, LIKE, IS NULL).

</details>
<details>
<summary>12. What is the purpose of the AND operator in SQL? How is it used?</summary>
The AND operator is used in SQL to combine multiple conditions and return only those rows that satisfy all the conditions. It is used in the WHERE clause of an SQL query to specify multiple conditions that must all be true for a row to be returned.
</details>
<details>
<summary>13. Can you give an example of how the OR operator works in SQL?</summary>
The OR operator is used in SQL to combine multiple conditions and return any rows that satisfy at least one of the conditions. For example:
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE country = 'USA' OR country = 'Canada';
```
This SQL query will return all customers who are either from the USA or Canada.
</details>
<details>
<summary>14. How does the NOT operator work in SQL? Can you give an example of how it's used?</summary>
The NOT operator is used in SQL to negate a condition and return rows that do not satisfy the condition. For example:
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE NOT country = 'USA';
```
This SQL query will return all customers who are not from the USA.
</details>
<details>
<summary>15. How do you combine AND and OR operators in an SQL query to create more complex conditions?</summary>

You can use parentheses to group conditions together and create more complex conditions in an SQL query.

For example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE (country = 'USA' AND state = 'CA') OR (country = 'Canada' AND city = 'Toronto');
```

This SQL query will return all customers who are either from the USA and California, or from Canada and Toronto.

</details>
<details>
<summary>16. What are some common mistakes to avoid when using AND, OR, and NOT operators in SQL queries?</summary>
Some common mistakes to avoid when using AND, OR, and NOT operators in SQL queries include forgetting to use parentheses to group conditions together.
</details>
<details>
<summary>17. Can you sort the results of an SQL query by multiple columns?</summary>
Yes, you can sort the results of an SQL query by multiple columns by specifying multiple column names in the ORDER BY clause separated by commas. For example:
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers
ORDER BY last_name ASC, first_name ASC;
```
This SQL query will return all customers in ascending order by last name and then by first name.
</details>
<details>
<summary>18. How do you use the INSERT INTO statement in SQL?</summary>
To use the INSERT INTO statement in SQL, you specify the name of the table you want to insert data into, followed by the column names (optional) and the values you want to insert. For example:
```sql
INSERT INTO customers (first_name, last_name, email)
VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'johndoe@example.com');
```
This SQL query will insert a new row into the "customers" table with the values 'John', 'Doe', and 'johndoe@example.com' in the columns "first_name", "last_name", and "email", respectively.
</details>

<details>
<summary>19. How do you check for NULL values in a SQL query?</summary>

To check for NULL values in a SQL query, you can use the IS NULL operator. For example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE email IS NULL;
```

This SQL query will return all rows from the "customers" table where the "email" column contains a NULL value.

</details>
<details>
<summary>20. How do you update all rows in a table?</summary>

To update all rows in a table, you can omit the WHERE clause from the UPDATE statement. For example:

```sql
UPDATE customers
SET status = 'active';
```

This SQL query will update the value of the "status" column in all rows of the "customers" table to 'active'.

<details>
  <summary>21. What is a SQL function?</summary>
<p>A SQL function is a subprogram that can be called by a SQL statement to perform a specific task. It returns a value or values, and can accept input parameters to modify its behavior.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>22. What is the syntax for calling a SQL function?</summary>
<p>The syntax for calling a SQL function is:</p>
```sql
SELECT function_name(parameter1, parameter2, ...);
```
<p>For example, to call the MAX function to return the maximum value in a column:</p>
```sql
SELECT MAX(column_name) FROM table_name;
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>23. What are some commonly used SQL functions? </summary>
- COUNT: returns the number of rows in a table that meet a certain condition
- SUM: returns the sum of values in a column
- AVG: returns the average of values in a column
- MIN: returns the minimum value in a column
- MAX: returns the maximum value in a column
- CONCAT: concatenates two or more strings
- SUBSTRING: extracts a substring from a string
</details>

<details>
<summary>24. What is the % wildcard character used for in a LIKE statement?</summary>
<p>The % wildcard character represents any number of characters, including zero characters. For example, the pattern 'b%' would match any string that starts with the letter 'b', such as 'blue', 'big', and 'box'.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>25. What is the _ wildcard character used for in a LIKE statement?</summary>
<p>The _ wildcard character represents a single character. For example, the pattern 'a_c' would match any string that starts with the letter 'a', followed by any single character, and ends with the letter 'c', such as 'abc', 'arc', and 'alc'.</p>
</details>
