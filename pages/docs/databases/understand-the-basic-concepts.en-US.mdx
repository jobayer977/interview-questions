# Understand the basic concepts

A relational database is like a big library for storing information. Think of it like a set of bookshelves, where each bookshelf is called a "table". Each table has many books, and each book is called a "row". Each book has many pages, and each page is called a "column". Each book has a special name, like "Harry Potter" or "The Hobbit", and this special name is called a "key". Some books go together, like a cookbook and a recipe book, and these are called "relationships". Just like you can find a book quickly by looking for the book's name, a computer can find information quickly in a relational database by looking for the key.

For example, in a restaurant, the menu items are the books and each item has its own unique name, that is the key and the ingredients of each item can be considered as the pages of the book.

### SQL (Structured Query Language)

SQL (Structured Query Language) is like a special language that you can use to talk to a relational database. It's like when you want to ask the librarian for a book, you need to know the name of the book, and you have to ask in a certain way so the librarian can understand you.

- **SELECT** is like asking the librarian for a book, you tell the computer which book you want by writing the name of the table and the columns you want to see.

- **INSERT** is like giving the librarian a new book to put on the shelf, you tell the computer the name of the table and the information you want to add.

- **UPDATE** is like asking the librarian to change something about a book, you tell the computer the name of the table, the name of the book you want to change, and the new information you want to add.

- **DELETE** is like asking the librarian to take a book off the shelf, you tell the computer the name of the table and the name of the book you want to remove.

It is important to learn the basics of SQL statements to interact with relational databases effectively. Just like how you would need to know how to ask for a book in a library in order to find what you are looking for, you need to know how to write SQL statements to retrieve, add, modify and delete data in a relational database.

### Choose a Database

- **MySQL:** MySQL is an open-source relational database management system that is widely used and easy to set up and use. It is known for its good performance and scalability, and has a large community of users and developers for support and resources. MySQL supports SQL (Structured Query Language) and is often used for web applications, mobile apps, and other software systems.

- **PostgreSQL:** PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system that is known for its powerful and flexible features. It has strong support for data integrity and consistency, and is well-suited for large-scale and complex systems. PostgreSQL supports SQL, JSON, and other data types, and provides advanced features such as constraints and triggers for data integrity.

- **SQL Server:** SQL Server is a commercial relational database management system developed and marketed by Microsoft. It is well-suited for large-scale and enterprise systems, and has a lot of features and tools that are designed to help with performance and scalability. SQL Server supports SQL, and it is often used for data warehousing and business intelligence.

- **Oracle:** Oracle is a proprietary relational database management system that is powerful and feature-rich. It has strong support for data integrity and consistency, and has built-in tools and features to help with performance and scalability. Oracle supports SQL
