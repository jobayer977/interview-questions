Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer looking to expand your skills, this is the perfect resource to help you boost the art of server-side development.

### What is backend development

Backend development refers to the server-side of web development, which is responsible for managing and processing data, and communicating with the frontend (the client-side of web development) through APIs. Backend developers write code in programming languages such as Python, Java, or NodeJS etc, to create and maintain the server-side logic and functionality of a website or application. They also work with databases to store and retrieve data, and create and implement APIs that allow the frontend to communicate with the backend. Backend development is an essential part of web development as it enables the smooth functioning and data management of a website or application.
