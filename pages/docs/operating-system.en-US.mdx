<summary>1. What is the POSIX standard and what does it specify?</summary>

The POSIX standard, or Portable Operating System Interface, specifies a set of APIs and standards for software development on Unix-like operating systems. It provides a common interface for interacting with the operating system, including file management, process management, and inter-process communication.

<summary>2. How does POSIX handle process management?</summary>

POSIX provides a set of functions for creating, managing, and terminating processes. These functions include fork(), exec(), and wait(). The fork() function creates a new process, the exec() function replaces the current process with a new one, and the wait() function waits for a child process to terminate.

<summary>3. What is the difference between POSIX and UNIX?</summary>

UNIX is a proprietary operating system developed by Bell Labs in the 1970s, while POSIX is a set of standards for ensuring compatibility and interoperability between different UNIX-based operating systems. UNIX is not necessarily POSIX-compliant, but many UNIX-like operating systems, such as Linux and macOS, are POSIX-compliant.

<details>
<summary>4. How does POSIX ensure compatibility between different operating systems?</summary>

POSIX defines a set of standard APIs, system calls, and command-line utilities that all POSIX-compliant operating systems must implement. This ensures that programs written to the POSIX standard will run the same way on any POSIX-compliant operating system.

<summary>5. What is the role of the C library in the POSIX standard?</summary>

The C library is a collection of functions and macros that provide standard functionality for POSIX-compliant operating systems. These functions include things like input/output operations, memory management, and string manipulation. The C library is a crucial component of the POSIX standard, as it provides a consistent programming interface across different operating systems.
